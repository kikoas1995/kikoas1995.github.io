In these series of posts I will relate how I completed every exercise in order to certify as a **SLAE** (_Security Linux Assembly Expert_), which is
a certification from [**PentesterAcademy**](https://www.pentesteracademy.com). I decided to take it because I heard very good references about it, and also because I need to prepare for my next objective, the OSCE.

In short, this certification requires the student to be able to develop code with easiness in **Assembly x86**, as well as master the [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) 
If you want to look up the exam requirements, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agwqgm52p3I) is the official video from TheSecurityTube that explains every required exercise.
