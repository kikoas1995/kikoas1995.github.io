I"Ÿ<p>In these series of posts I will relate how I completed every exercise in order to certify as a <strong>SLAE</strong> (<em>Security Linux Assembly Expert</em>), which is
a certification from <a href="https://www.pentesteracademy.com"><strong>PentesterAcademy</strong></a>. I decided to take it because I heard very good references about it, and also because I need to prepare for my next objective, the OSCE.</p>
