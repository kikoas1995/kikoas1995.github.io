I"«<p>In these series of posts I will relate how I completed every exercise in order to certify as a <strong>SLAE</strong> (<em>Security Linux Assembly Expert</em>), which is
a certification from <a href="https://www.pentesteracademy.com"><strong>PentesterAcademy</strong></a>. I decided to take it because I heard very good references about it, and also because I need to prepare for my next objective, the OSCE.</p>

<p>In short, this certification requires the student to be able to develope code with easyness in <strong>Assembly x86</strong>, as well as master the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">gdb</a> 
If you want to look up the exam requirements, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agwqgm52p3I">here</a> is the official video from TheSecurityTube that explains every required exercise.</p>

<p>Without more explanations, letâ€™s dive into the exercises!</p>
