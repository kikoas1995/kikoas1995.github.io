I"<p>I am a Computer Engineer with a Master’s in Cybersecurity, graduated in Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. I also hold an <strong>Offensive Security Certified Professional</strong> certification (OSCP).</p>

<p>I have a humongous interest in the hacking field, where I try to spend a big part of my free time in order to become a better professional.</p>

<p>I am currently working in Innovery as a <em>Blue-teamer</em>. My actual tasks are implementing new flex connectors in Arcsight SIEM as well as making new correlation rules for alerts, automatizing processess (such as SFTP, SSH, etc), and documenting. 
I have also worked as a Software Engineer for defence&amp;space projects (most of development cycle areas of satellital embedded software projects, such as design and implementation), and as a Cybersecurity Legal Auditor, performing NIST and IS27001 based audits.</p>

<p>However, my objective is to be able to become part of a Red Team and participate in internal/external audits. I have also a lot of interest of malware research/analysis, web and mobile penetration testing, Wifi audits, RFID and Hardware hacking…</p>

<p>My main skills are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Developer:</strong> I have high coding skills in <code class="highlighter-rouge">python</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">bash</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Java</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code>, among many others.</li>
  <li><strong>Ethical Hacking:</strong> BoF, infrastructure pentesting, port forwarding skills, AV evasion…</li>
</ul>
