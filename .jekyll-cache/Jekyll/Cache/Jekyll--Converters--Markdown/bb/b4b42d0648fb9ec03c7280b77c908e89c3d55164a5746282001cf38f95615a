I"•	<p>Hello!</p>

<p>My name is Kiko. I am a <strong>Computer Engineer</strong> and <strong>Masterâ€™s Degree in Cybersecurity</strong> (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid). I also hold an <strong>Offensive Security Certified Professional certification</strong> (OSCP), among others.</p>

<p>I have a humongous interest in anything related to cybersecurity, but I put special focus in offensive security, and how things can be broken to my interest. I spend lot of my free time learning and studying in order to become a better professional of the field, doing Hack The Box and Vulnhub challenges.</p>

<p>I am currently working as a Blue-teamer. My main tasks are implementing new connectors for ArcSight SIEM, automatizing processess such as SSH/SFTP/FTP connections between different machines, generating alerts/reports, documentingâ€¦ 
Additionally, I have also worked doing Cybersecurity regulatory audits such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework or ISO 27k1. I also hold some months of experience as a defense&amp;space software developer, where I participated in several parts of Software Development Cycle such as design, implementation and testing.</p>

<p>However, what I have always wanted, my main focus, is to become part of a Red team and perform internal/external audits, perform web and mobile app penetration testing, WiFi auditsâ€¦ I also have a lot of interest for RFID, hardware hacking (Raspberry and arduino projects) and physical pentesting.</p>

<p>My main skills are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ethical Hacking:</strong> Systems Pentesting, BOF, port forwarding, AV evasion, persistence, AD pentestingâ€¦</li>
  <li><strong>Developer:</strong> I have high skills in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Python</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Java</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code>, among others.</li>
</ul>
