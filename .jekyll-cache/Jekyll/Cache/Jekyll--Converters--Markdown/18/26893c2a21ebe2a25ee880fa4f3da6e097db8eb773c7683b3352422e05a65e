I"d<p>In this post I will relate how I completed every exercise in order to certify as a <strong>SLAE</strong> (<em>Security Linux Assembly Expert</em>), which is
a certification from <strong>PentesterAcademy</strong>. I decided to take it because I heard very good references about it, and also because I need to prepare for my next objective, the OSCE.</p>
