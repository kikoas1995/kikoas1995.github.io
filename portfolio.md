Hello!

My name is Kiko. I am a **Computer Engineer** and **Master's Degree in Cybersecurity** (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid). I also hold an __Offensive Security Certified Professional certification__ (OSCP), among others.

I have a humongous interest in anything related to cybersecurity, but I put special focus in offensive security, and how things can be broken to my interest. I spend lot of my free time learning and studying in order to become a better professional of the field, doing Hack The Box and Vulnhub challenges.

I am currently working as a Blue-teamer. My main tasks are implementing new connectors for ArcSight SIEM, automatizing processess such as SSH/SFTP/FTP connections between different machines, generating alerts/reports, documenting... 
Additionally, I have also worked doing Cybersecurity regulatory audits such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework or ISO 27k1. I also hold some months of experience as a defense&space software developer, where I participated in several parts of Software Development Cycle such as design, implementation and testing.

However, what I have always wanted, my main focus, is to become part of a Red team and perform internal/external audits, perform web and mobile app penetration testing, WiFi audits... I also have a lot of interest for RFID technologies, hardware hacking (Raspberry and arduino projects) and physical pentesting.

I will try to publish things ~~frequently~~, so stay tuned.

My main skills are:

* **Ethical Hacking:** Systems Pentesting, BOF, port forwarding, AV evasion, persistence, AD pentesting...
* **Developer:** I have high skills in `Python`, `bash`, `Java` and `C`, among others.
