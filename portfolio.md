Hello!

My name is Kiko. I am a **Computer Engineer** who loves to play with security in systems. I also like learning and achieving practical hacking courses.

I have a huge interest in anything related to cybersecurity, but I put special focus in offensive security, and how things can be broken. I spend lot of my free time learning and studying in order to become a better professional of the field, doing Hack The Box and Vulnhub challenges.

I am currently working as a pentester. My main tasks are performing web black-box audits. 
Additionally, I have also worked doing BlueTeaming with SIEMs, Cybersecurity regulatory audits such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework or ISO 27k1. I also hold some months of experience as a defense&space software developer, where I participated in several parts of Software Development Cycle such as design, implementation and testing.

I would love to do internal/external enterprise audits, OT and physical pentests and also learn WiFi hacking more deeply. I also have a lot of interest for RFID technologies, hardware hacking (Raspberry and arduino projects).

I will try to publish things ~~frequently~~, such as retired HTB boxes writeups, hardware cool projects etc.

My main skills are:

* **Ethical Hacking:** Systems Pentesting, BOF, pivoting, AV evasion, persistence, web pentesting, binary exploitation...
* **Developer:** I have some skills in `Python`, `bash`, `Java` and `C`, among others.
